Today, we're finally releasing the **v1.0.0**. ðŸŽ‰

This release was focused on adding new components to the library, which counts **a total of 9 pure css UI components** ðŸš€.

Here's the list of the new additions: 

- [**Fullpage Slider**](/docs/components/fullpage/) component
- [**Range Slider**](/docs/components/range/) component
- [**Toggle**](/docs/components/toggle/) component

At the start of 2022, [we planned to create some components](/blog/2022-product-roadmap/) which then were excluded. The reason for this was mainly for the lack of browser support.

We hope you enjoy it! ðŸ™Œ
